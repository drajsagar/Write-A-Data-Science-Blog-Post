## Project Objective
* The prime objective of this project is very clear, that we want to predict the whether an applicant can be approved of home loan or not by applying machine learninig techniques

* Eploring and Analyzing the data

* Handling the outliers and missing data values

* Apply differnt machine learning algorthims to understand how accurate they can preduct

* Finalizing the Machine learning model to build predict loan approval process
